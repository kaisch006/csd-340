    <h2>Chapter 1: Personal Introduction</h2>
    <p class="intro">Hello! My name is Christopher Kaiser. I’m currently entering my Senior Year at Bellevue University majoring in Software Development. Prior to starting this degree I did not have experience with programing or website design.</p>
    <p><span class="sentence">I currently work as a security guard for Walt Disney World.</span> They have an amazing program from workers called Aspire which provides full paid tuition and books towards any bachelor program offered by participating universities. You only have to work for the company 90 days to be eligible and can even do so part time, 3 days a week. It’s something I recommend for anyone trying to afford college.</p>
    <p>My hobbies include board games, tabletop roleplaying games, and computer games. I occasionally perform as a paid host of virtual tabletop roleplaying games for some supplemental income. My hope is to turn my love of gaming into a career whether it’s creating peripheral applications or games for educational purposes.</p>
    <p>My hometown in Orlando. During the hot summer days I enjoy cooling off in many of the nearby water parks, natural springs, or beaches. I think this location is perfect for an aspiring software developer as there are many software companies in close proximity.</p>
